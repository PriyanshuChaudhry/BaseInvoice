- **Perfect alignment** for all 9 columns (S.No, Particulars, Qty, Unit, Rate, CGST%, SGST%, IGST%, Amount)
- **Text wrapping** for long item names (Particulars column)
- **Light gray header background** (`#f0f0f0`) for better visibility
- **Proper borders** with consistent cell structure
- **Dynamic row heights** based on content
- **Page break handling** - table header repeats on new pages

### Column Widths:
```
S.No: 30px
Particulars: 180px (with text wrapping)
Qty: 30px
Unit: 35px
Rate: 50px
CGST%: 35px
SGST%: 35px
IGST%: 35px
Amount: 65px
Total Width: 495px (fits perfectly in A4)
```

## 🧮 3. Intelligent Tax Logic - IMPLEMENTED ✅

### Automatic Tax Field Management:

**When Company State == Customer State (Intra-State):**
- ✅ CGST field ENABLED
- ✅ SGST field ENABLED
- ❌ IGST field DISABLED (grayed out, auto-set to 0)
- 💡 Blue indicator: "Intra-State Transaction: CGST + SGST will apply"

**When Company State != Customer State (Inter-State):**
- ❌ CGST field DISABLED (grayed out, auto-set to 0)
- ❌ SGST field DISABLED (grayed out, auto-set to 0)
- ✅ IGST field ENABLED
- 💡 Purple indicator: "Inter-State Transaction: IGST will apply"

### Real-Time Updates:
- Tax fields update **instantly** when state is selected
