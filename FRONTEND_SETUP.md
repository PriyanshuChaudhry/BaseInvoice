# üé® Frontend Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ What's Already Created

1. **App.js** - Updated with navigation tabs
2. **QuotationForm.js** - Full quotation creation form

## üìù Components You Need to Create

I've created the core structure. Now you need to create 3 more simple components:

### 1. ProformaForm.js
Create: `frontend/src/components/ProformaForm.js`

This component should:
- Have an input field for "Quotation Number"
- Have inputs for bank details (Bank Name, Account Number, IFSC Code, Branch)
- Submit to `/api/proforma/create`

### 2. FinalInvoiceForm.js  
Create: `frontend/src/components/FinalInvoiceForm.js`

This component should:
- Have an input field for "Quotation Number"
- Have inputs for bank details
- Have inputs for dispatch details (Delivery Type, Dispatch Date, Courier Name, Tracking Number)
- Submit to `/api/finalinvoices/create`

### 3. DocumentList.js
Create: `frontend/src/components/DocumentList.js`

This component should:
- Fetch and display all quotations from `/api/quotations/all`
- Fetch and display all proforma invoices from `/api/proforma/all`
- Fetch and display all final invoices from `/api/finalinvoices/all`
- Show them in a nice table format
